.SH DESCRIPTION
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP IPv6-Transport Relay Agent,
dhctra, provides a means for relaying DHCPv4 requests over IPv6 from a
subnet to which no DHCP IPv6-transport server is directly connected to
one or more DHCPv4 servers on other subnets.
.SH OPERATION
.PP
The DHCP IPv6-Transport Relay Agent listens for DHCPv4 queries over
IPv6 from Client Relay Agents at one or more IPv6 addresses, passing
them along to ``upstream'' standard DHCPv4 servers or relay agents as
specified on the command line.
When a reply is received from upstream, it is relayed back over IPv6
downstream to the source of the original request carried in a CRA6ADDR
Relay Agent Suboption.
.SH COMMAND LINE
.TP
-c COUNT
Maximum hop count.  When forwarding packets, dhctra discards packets
which have reached a hop count of COUNT.  Default is 10.  Maximum is 255.
.TP
-d
Force dhctra to run as a foreground process.  Useful when running
dhctra under a debugger, or running out of inittab on System V systems.
.TP
-p PORT
Listen and transmit on port PORT.  This is mostly useful for debugging
purposes.  Default is port 67.
.TP
-q
Quiet mode.  Prevents dhctra from printing its network configuration
on startup.
.TP
-pf pid-file
Path to alternate pid file.
.TP
--no-pid
Option to disable writing pid files.  By default the program
will write a pid file.
.TP
-a
Append extra (to CRA6ADDR) agent options to each request before
forwarding it to the server.  Agent option fields in responses sent
from servers to clients will be stripped before forwarding such
responses back to the client.  The agent option field will contain two
agent options: the Circuit ID suboption and the Remote ID suboption.
Currently, the Circuit ID will be the printable name of the interface
on which the client request was received.  The client supports
inclusion of a Remote ID suboption as well, but this is not used by
default.
.TP
-A LENGTH
Specify the maximum packet size to send to a DHCPv4 server.  This
might be done to allow sufficient space for addition of relay agent
options while still fitting into the Ethernet MTU size.
.TP
-D
Drop packets from upstream servers if they contain Relay Agent
Information options that indicate they were generated in response to
a query that came via a different relay agent.  If this option is not
specified, such packets will be relayed anyway.
.TP
server
A list of one or more server IPv4 addresses to which DHCP queries should be
relayed.
